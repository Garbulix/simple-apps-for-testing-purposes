# simple-apps-for-testing-purposes
Simple apps that are designed for automated testing practe. Made especially for me but may be useful for someone else.

I am aware a lot of functions may be written more efficiently, but my priority was to undarstand what I write (and copy).

# TODO
## create more simple programs
- pangram checker
- counter of number of times a given letter occurs in given string
- Caesar cipher tool
